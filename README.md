Material Classification for Clean Energy Applications

New materials need to be synthesized and characterized to improve existing clean energy applications. The task is to predict the material classes based on their given molecular properties and achieve the highest accuracy of classification.


1.   **Data Visualization and Unsupervised Classification**: Visualize the data and implement PCA and K-means to  separate different classes. 
2.   **Classification of materials**: Implement a Decision tree classifier, Random Forest (RF), and KNN classifier on the dataset and estimate the accuracies, F-1 score, and confusion matrix. Report the best classifier.
3.   **Hyperparameter tuning**: Implement hyperparameter tuning on random forest and KNN algorithms. Report the best-performing model and the respective hyperparameters with the highest accuracy.
4. **Most important features**:  Estimate the order of best-performing features.
5. **XGBoost**:  Implement XGBoost on the data. Perform hyper-parameter tuning and report the highest accuracy you achieve. 
6. **Neural Networks**: In the era of generative AI, which is powered by neural networks, let's see how neural nets perform compared to other ML classification models. Implement a neural network to predict the class
